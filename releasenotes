smb2-handler 53.1 (20.12.2022)

- First released version.


smb2-handler 53.2 (29.12.2022)

- Added USER and PASSWORD arguments.

- Disabled CTRL-C signal checking in libc and ISocket->WaitSelect().

- Merged latest fixes from the libsmb2 github repo:
  - Convert system time to little endian in NTLMSSP code.
  - Convert destination path directory separators in rename function.


smb2-handler 53.3 (8.1.2023)

- Added a workaround for smb2_rmdir() not returning an error when trying to
  delete a non-empty directory.

- Added support for READONLY switch.

- If the reported f_blocks is larger than INT32_MAX statfs() will reduce it
  and compensate by making the block size larger (that way at least programs
  that use the id_NumBlocks, id_NumBlocksUsed and id_BytesPerBlock fields to
  calculate used and free percentages will report reasonable results).


smb2-handler 53.4 (18.1.2023)

- Rewrote the readv() and writev() implementations according to:
  https://github.com/sahlberg/libsmb2/issues/242

- Merged latest changes from libsmb2:
  - Read share flags and use encryption if needed.
  - Fix ntlm_convert_password_hash on big endian.

- Added AmigaOS 3 and AROS ports (the AmigaOS 3 port is thanks to the work of
  Szilard Biro).


smb2-handler 53.5 (28.4.2023)

- Added a MUI password requester for the AROS port (based on code provided by
  Szilard Biro).

- Reduced the minimum bsdsocket.library version from 4 to 3 in AmigaOS 3/AROS
  ports.

- Merged error requester code from Szilard Biro.

- Made smb2fs_init() call smb2_set_domain() if url->domain is not NULL.


smb2-handler 53.6 (25.5.2023)

- read_startup_args() now uses AllocDosObject() to create the RDArgs for
  ReadArgs() instead of allocating it locally on the stack. Strangely this bug
  didn't seem to cause any problems on AmigaOS 4 but on AmigaOS 3 it caused an
  AN_BadFreeAddr (#0100000F) alert on filesystem exit (ACTION_DIE).


smb2-handler 53.7 (17.6.2023)

- Merged latest changes from libsmb2 git repository.

- AmigaOS 3 version now uses ReqTools for the password requester.

- Now uses an empty string instead of a NULL pointer when connecting to a
  share without a password.

- AROS version no longer gets SysBase by reading it from AbsExecBase.

- AROS version: Replaced fcntl() and close() calls with IoctlSocket() and
  CloseSocket().


smb2-handler 53.8 (15.5.2024)

- IMPORTANT: this revision only supports m86k-amigaos target

- implemented proper disposal of libsmb2 context on connection fault

- implemented automatic reconnection handling

- experimental recovery of handles during file operations
  interrupted by connection fault. Please note: the SMB server might still cause lock issue,
  reported by "..busy" "..in use" errors on workbench. This can't be solved within this handler,
  unless libsmb2 supports durable handles.
