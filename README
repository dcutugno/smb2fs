PLEASE_NOTE: This Release (53.8) does only support the m86k-amigaos target. I have no way to test it for the other targets (AROS, OS4) and will therefor not release a version I can't support. A pull request to the original repository is made.

53.8 is an attempt to solve some longer lasting issues with connection faults. Details can be read in the release notes.

smb2-handler is a filesystem for accessing files remotely using the SMB2/3
protocols. The protocol implementation is based on the currently latest git
version of libsmb2 (https://github.com/sahlberg/libsmb2).

Requirements:

- newlib.library V53.40 or newer (or V53.30 as included in 4.1 FE).

- filesysbox.library 54.4 or newer.

Usage:

Create a DOSDriver with the contents:
Handler   = L:smb2-handler
StackSize = 65536
Priority  = 5
GlobVec   = -1
Startup   = "<args>"

Where <args> should follow the template:

URL/A,USER,PASSWORD,VOLUME,READONLY/S,NOPASSWORDREQ/S,NOHANDLESRCV/S,RECONNECTREQ/S

URL is the address of the samba share in the format:
smb://[<domain;][<username>[:<password>]@]<host>[:<port>]/<share>/<path>

USER and PASSWORD arguments if used override the username and password (if
any) specified in the URL argument.

VOLUME is the AmigaDOS volume name (if not specified it defaults to
<server>-<share>).

READONLY sets the filesystem to read only mode.

NOPASSWORDREQ stops a password requester from being opened if no password is
specified.

NOHANDLESRCV/S disables the automatic recovery of filehandles after a connection fault is resolved. This should not be needed, but the SMB server might still cause lock issue, reported by "..busy" "..in use" errors on workbench. This can't be solved within this handler, unless libsmb2 supports durable handles.

RECONNECTREQ/S requests the user if a reconnection should be attempted. This is part of an initial implementation of connection fault handling and might not be needed, as the final implementation relies on OS "No disk - retry" mechanism. Still, if you have issues, you might try this option. Depending on user feedback this option will be removed in future releases.

To connect to the share myshare on server mypc using username "myuser" and
password "password123" use:

Startup = "smb://myuser:password123@mypc/myshare"

If the user name or password contains reserved characters (: ; @) the 
USER and PASSWORD arguments can be used instead:

Startup = "smb://mypc/myshare USER=myuser PASSWORD=password123"

If you prefer not to store the password as plain text, you can also use its
NTLM hash with the following syntax:

Startup = "smb://mypc/myshare USER=myuser PASSWORD=ntlm:HASHABCDEF"

To connect to the same share using a guest account you can use:

Startup = "smb://mypc/myshare NOPASSWORDREQ"

To give the mounted share a custom name the VOLUME argument can be used:

Startup = "smb://mypc/myshare VOLUME=MyShare"

If you want the handler to be started immediately on mount, rather than on the
first access, then make sure that ACTIVATE=1 is set in either in the icon
tooltypes or in the DOSDriver file itself.
