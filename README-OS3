smb2-handler is a filesystem for accessing files remotely using the SMB2/3
protocols. The protocol implementation is based on the currently latest git
version of libsmb2 (https://github.com/sahlberg/libsmb2).

Requirements:

- AmigaOS 3.0 or newer.

- Optional: ReqTools for the password requester.

- filesysbox.library 54.3 or newer.

- AmiTCP 3.0 or any compatible TCP/IP stack.

- Optional: KillDev from IDEfix97 for unmounting.

Usage:

Create a DOSDriver with the contents:
Handler   = L:smb2-handler
StackSize = 65536
Priority  = 5
GlobVec   = -1
Startup   = "<args>"

Where <args> should follow the template:

URL/A,USER,PASSWORD,VOLUME,DOMAIN/K,READONLY/S,NOPASSWORDREQ/S,NOHANDLESRCV/S,
RECONNECTREQ/S

URL is the address of the samba share in the format:
smb://[<domain;][<username>[:<password>]@]<host>[:<port>]/<share>/<path>

USER and PASSWORD arguments if used override the username and password (if
any) specified in the URL argument.

VOLUME is the AmigaDOS volume name (if not specified it defaults to
<server>-<share>).

DOMAIN can be used to set the domain name (setting this via the URL argument
does not work ATM as c:mount treats anything after a semi-colon as a comment,
even if it's between double-quotes).

READONLY sets the filesystem to read only mode.

NOPASSWORDREQ stops a password requester from being opened if no password is
specified.

NOHANDLESRCV/S disables the automatic recovery of filehandles after a
connection fault is resolved. This should not be needed, but the SMB server
might still cause lock issue, reported by "..busy" "..in use" errors on
workbench. This can't be solved within this handler, unless libsmb2 supports
durable handles.

RECONNECTREQ/S requests the user if a reconnection should be attempted. This
is part of an initial implementation of connection fault handling and might
not be needed, as the final implementation relies on OS "No disk - retry"
mechanism. Still, if you have issues, you might try this option. Depending on
user feedback this option will be removed in future releases.

To connect to the share myshare on server mypc using username "myuser" and
password "password123" use:

Startup = "smb://myuser:password123@mypc/myshare"

If the user name or password contains reserved characters (: ; @) the 
USER and PASSWORD arguments can be used instead:

Startup = "smb://mypc/myshare USER=myuser PASSWORD=password123"

If you prefer not to store the password as plain text, you can also use its
NTLM hash with the following syntax:

Startup = "smb://mypc/myshare USER=myuser PASSWORD=ntlm:HASHABCDEF"

To connect to the same share using a guest account you can use:

Startup = "smb://mypc/myshare NOPASSWORDREQ"

To give the mounted share a custom name the VOLUME argument can be used:

Startup = "smb://mypc/myshare VOLUME=MyShare"

If you want the handler to be started immediately on mount, rather than on the
first access, then make sure that ACTIVATE=1 is set in either in the icon
tooltypes or in the DOSDriver file itself.

To unmount the share, set the DOSDEV tooltype in KillDev's icon to the name
of the DOSDriver file, then start KillDev from Workbench. This can also be
used if the volume couldn't be mounted, and you get a "device already mounted"
message.
